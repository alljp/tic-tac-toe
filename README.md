# tic-tac-toe


An implementation of the tic tac toe game in python, done for learning purposes.

Has options to select the board size, and whether you want to play against a player or the computer.
The game engine uses a bruteforce algorithm to look for a move that doesnot let the user win. Works perfectly for a 3x3 board. In case of an NxN board, it doesnot play optimally, but finds the best move that does not let the player win. 

Usage
Clone the repo and run python3 tic_tac_toe.py
