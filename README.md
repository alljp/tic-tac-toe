# tic-tac-toe


An implementation of the tic tac toe game in python, done for learning purposes.

Has options to select the board size, and whether you want to play against a player or the computer.
The game engine uses a bruteforce algorithm to look for a move that doesnot let the user win. Works perfectly for a 3x3 board. In case of an NxN board, it doesnot play optimally, but finds the best move that does not let the player win. 

Usage:

step 1: Clone the repo 
step 2:  run python3 tic_tac_toe.py
